# Getting Started

### Requirements
For test this project you will need

* java 21
* docker
* gradle optional

### Guides

To build the root project

`./gradlew build`

Then startup docker database with `docker compose -f docker-compose-postgresql.yml up`

Then execute the services with the following command in each subproject

`./gradlew bootRun`

or run the jar file generated by the build command with:
- `java -jar ecommerce/build/libs/ecommerce-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- `java -jar payment-gateway/build/libs/payment-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Another way to run the services is to build docker images with `docker-image.sh` script
in each subproject and run them with `docker compose up`

Remember To just run the docker database `docker compose -f docker-compose-postgresql.yml up`

There is **swagger ui** at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html available

### NOTES

- I choose to organize the project by feature so each resource has its own package,
- The model (jpa entities) has its own package
- I added a simple filter as dummy security
- Added some curl request to the endpoints, they could be imported in postman or similar client
